## Hello everyone, My name is Ikkou Fujishima. Today, I will discuss about ORC in Waste-to-Energy.
## @next

## I'm gonna start with small talk, actually Japan has 1,004 incineration plants. let me explain about MSW on this slide, it's Municipal Solid Waste. means, normal waste like illustration you can see, 
## @next

## other than this, there are industrial waste and waste from sewage. MSW means normal one, from your houses, and stores in town.
## @next

----
## as an example of MSW incineration plant, this Kyoto Nanbu clean center, and Tanba city clean center. 
## @next

----
## This number, 1,004, is quite significant. It's too many I would say. 
## @next

----
## in Taiwan, there are only 25 incineration plants.

## @next

----
## When you look at the population, population per incineration plant in Japan is about 122k people, while in Taiwan it's about 932k people. The figure for Taiwan is 7.6 times higher.

## @next

----
## And average incineration capacity, that means how much waste you can incinerate in a day, is 6.2 times higher in Taiwan.

## @next

----
## Let's go back to examples, this Kyoto Nanbu clean center, that is large one in japan, top 5%, has a capacity of 500 tons per day.

## @next

----
## While, Tanba clean center has a capacity of only 46 tons per day.

## @next

----
## so, I think I can say that Japan has so many small incineration plants across the country.

## @next

----
## Let's talk about generation. At first, I'm gonna talk about methods to generate energy. You know, there are several ways to do this, PVs, use hydrogen, or, spin turbines. To spin turbines, common methods is using steam, I mean water vaper. We call this method "Steam Rankin Cycle". 

## However, steam rankin cycle has some limitations, for example, it requires high temperature and high pressure.

## @next

----
## To solve this problem, we can use Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). By using organic fluids with lower boiling points than water, ORC can generate power from low-temperature heat sources or small scale heat sources. So, let's go back to Japan's incineration plants. Because there are many incineration plants that do not have generators.

## This is MB-70 from KOBELCO installed in Tanba Clean Center, that is owned by a municipality. It's only 70 kW, and it generates only 20 kW actually.
