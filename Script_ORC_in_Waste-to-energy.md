## Hello everyone, My name is Ikkou Fujishima. Today, I will discuss about ORC in Waste-to-Energy.
## @next

## I'm gonna start with small talk, actually Japan has 1,004 incineration plants. let me explain about MSW on this slide, it's Municipal Solid Waste. means, normal waste like illustration you can see, 
## @next

## other than this, there are industrial waste and waste from sewage. MSW means normal one, from your houses, and stores in town.
## @next

----
## as an example of MSW incineration plant, this Kyoto Nanbu clean center, and Tanba city clean center. 
## @next

----
## This number, 1,004, is quite significant. It's too many I would say. 
## @next

----
## in Taiwan, there are only 25 incineration plants.

## @next

----
## When you look at the population, population per incineration plant in Japan is about 122k people, while in Taiwan it's about 932k people. The figure for Taiwan is 7.6 times higher.

## @next

----
## And average incineration capacity, that means how much waste you can incinerate in a day, is 6.2 times higher in Taiwan.

## @next

----
## Let's go back to examples, this Kyoto Nanbu clean center, that is large one in japan, top 5%, has a capacity of 500 tons per day.

## @next

----
## While, Tanba clean center has a capacity of only 46 tons per day.

## @next

----
## so, I think I can say that Japan has so many small incineration plants across the country.

## @next

----
## Let's talk about generation. At first, I'm gonna talk about methods to generate energy. You know, there are several ways to do this, PVs, use hydrogen, or, spin turbines. To spin turbines, common methods is using steam, I mean water vaper. We call this method "Steam Rankin Cycle". 

## However, steam rankin cycle has some limitations, for example, it requires high temperature and high pressure.

## @next

----
## To solve this problem, we can use Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). By using organic fluids with lower boiling points than water, ORC can generate power from low-temperature heat sources or small scale heat sources. So, let's go back to Japan's incineration plants. Because there are many incineration plants that do not have generators.

## This is MB-70 from KOBELCO installed in Tanba Clean Center, that is owned by a municipality. It's only 70 kW, and it generates only 20 kW actually. KOBELCO is Japanese Steel company, No.3 in Japan. They built incineration plant 2015, also they installed ORC generator.

## @next

---------
## This is 125XLT from AccessEnergy installed in incineration plant of ERTEC Service, that is private company operating MSW plant. They installed 2 ORC generator, therefore capacity is 250 kW. Incineration plant itself has 81.6 tons per day capacity, and heat source is 100 degree Celsius of hot water. I expect the heat source has a sufficient flow rate, but we currently lack the data to confirm. I have reached out for more information to do interview.

## We've seen two examples of ORC installations in Japan's incineration plants. Finally, I would like to talk about the challenges of implementing ORC.

## @next

---------

## first one is the high failure rate. ORC is a relatively new technology, and there are still many unknowns about its long-term reliability. 

## @next
---------

## second one is the high initial cost. ORC systems can be expensive to install, and this can be a barrier for some incineration plants.

## @next
---------

## because of these challenges, the adoption of ORC in Japan's incineration plants has been slow. And some companies that were manufacturing ORC systems have gone out of business. 

## However, I believe that ORC still has the potential to be a valuable tool for generating energy from waste, and I hope to see more incineration plants adopt this technology in the future.
