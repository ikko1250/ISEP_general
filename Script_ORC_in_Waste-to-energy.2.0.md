All right. Hello everyone. My name is Fujisima Ikkou and I am from Ritsumeikan University. I'm going to talk about waste-to-energy related to incineration plants. I’ll mainly focus on the energy section. But for the first part of the presentation, I'm going to talk about incineration plants generally. After this, I'll discuss Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which is relatively new technology. It's not entirely new, but it's a newer technology to refer to a category of incineration plants.

I'll categorize incineration plants into a few types. The top one is municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants. This is normal waste from your houses or some stores in town. These plants are often owned by municipalities, and sometimes private companies join to operate them. The bottom two categories are industrial waste incineration plants and sewage   sludge incineration plants. Of course, there are many such plants, and the industrial sector is mainly owned and operated by private companies. Anyway, I'll focus on the top one, MSW incineration plants.

Regarding incineration plants, there are 1,004 waste incineration plants in Japan. This number is quite significant because in Taiwan, there are only 25 such plants. Of course, population differences account for some of this, but even considering that, there's still a big difference; Taiwan has 7.6 times more plants. When you look at the average incineration capacity – meaning how much waste can be incinerated in one day – there's also a significant difference, with Taiwan's capacity being 6.2 times higher.

Let's look at some examples of incineration plants. The Kyoto Nanbu Clean Center is near my house. Kyoto is quite a big city, so it has three incineration plants, and this one is the biggest. The Kyoto Nanbu Clean Center is big plant in Japan, like top 5%. But even this plant has a capacity of 500 tons per day. However, even this capacity doesn't reach the average capacity of a Taiwanese plant. If you look at the Tamba Creen Center, Tamba City is a small city in Hyogo Prefecture, so its capacity is only 46 tons per day.

So, as I mentioned, Japan has many small plants scattered across the nation. These small plants cause some problems. Only 40% of incineration plant installed generators; the other 60% do not even have generators. This is huge waste of heat.

When it comes to generators, the common way to generate electricity is using a steam turbine. This involves using water, applying heat to make water vapor (steam), and then spinning a turbine. This is a very common way to generate electricity and is called a Steam Rankine Cycle.

---
The Steam Rankine Cycle has some problems because it requires high temperatures, like above 200°C, and sometimes 400°C. Recently, some advanced coal generation requires high pressure and large turbines, which results in very high costs. It is quite difficult to install a Steam Rankine Cycle in small-capacity incineration plants, such as one with a 46-ton-per-day capacity.

Therefore, I'm going to introduce the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). The ORC uses a fluorocarbon-based working fluid that has a low boiling point. This enables electricity generation from low-temperature heat sources or small-scale heat sources. Because of this, ORC is currently mainly used in geothermal generation. In Japan, there are many hot springs, but their temperature is mainly under 100°C, and they don’t provide enough steam sources that can generate electricity with Steam Rankine Cycle turbines. However, by using ORC, where the boiling point of the working fluid is around -10°C or something, you can easily generate electricity with a 100°C heat source.

----

There's another benefit: it uses a quite small-scale generator. So, we can use ORC with small-scale heat sources. Since Japan, as I said, has so many small plants, we might be able to apply the Organic Rankine Cycle to these incineration plants.

This is a MB-70H from KOBELCO. It's only a 70-kilowatt power generator, but I would say it's not quite efficient in operation, with only 20-kilowatt output. I think it's not even profitable at this site. Of course, the utilization rate of this generator will be even lower than 20% or something. I would say it's not profitable, but this is the first example of implementing ORC into a municipality's incineration plant. It's a great thing.

---

With a 46-ton-per-day capacity, we cannot generate with a Steam Rankine Cycle, but using ORC, you can install this type of ORC for around 100 million yen. So, it's quite expensive, but it's affordable.

This is the Thermapower 125XLT, an Organic Rankine Cycle from an American company, Access Energy. There’s no information about the operation of these generators. I'm still researching this project. I sent an email to interview this company, but there's still no answer. So, I don't know, but if someone wants to join interview, please tell me. 

---
I think they could manage to get enough flow rate of the heat source. I mean, 100-degree hot water is used, and the flow rate (the amount of water provided from the incineration plant) is very important. But I would say I think at this site, there's going to be enough heat source to generate 250 kilowatts with the generators. This point is what I want to know through interview. 

---
All right, we've seen two examples. The generator in Ertec service was installed around 2013, and the Tamba Clean Center was installed in 2015. After that, I think there are no further examples of ORC installations, or maybe there's just no information, and some examples exist that I'm unaware of. At least, there hasn't been a big movement to install ORC.

So, let's talk about the current issues with ORC. Why do many incineration plants still operate without generators or with steam turbines? One reason is the high failure rate. As I said, ORC is used more in geothermal areas. When you look at some geothermal areas, some of the generators stopped operation within a few years. It's quite difficult to see, but the correlation rate is minus 0.3, and some generators are at 0% operation rate. I think one of these is a site I interviewed the municipality about, they said that after five years of installation, they are not working anymore. It's very... what can I say, many generators are broken. After that, you must pay a few million yen to fix them. It's no longer profitable, so they must stop generation. Some generators are working, but still the high failure rate is a big problem.

The second reason is high cost. It's a very, very expensive machine. In this committee, it shows that 2 million yen would be used per kilowatt for installation. The average cost of installing, for example, a PV (photovoltaic) system, would be some 100,000 yen per kilowatt. So, there's a very big difference between that. 
## @next 

Because of these two reasons, ORC adoption is slowing down, even in geothermal areas. Also, several companies like COBELCO and IHI that make small generators are withdrawing from manufacturing.


---
But there's still hope for ORC. There are still many small incineration plants in Japan, and we need to recover heat from them. The Steam Rankine Cycle is not profitable in these plants. So, maybe we can still use ORC. I'm going to continue to research about that. I think there's hope, I would say. So, this is the end of my presentation. Thank you very much.
